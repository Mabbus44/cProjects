DT tree of cubes
Saved in files in order of discovery
Cube value is determine by comparing value of position 0 first, then 1....
Each new cube is rotated in all 24 directions, only the direction with the smallest val is saved
Cubes refere to each other by an int, starting at 0, actual cube is found in
file (int)(ADR / CUBES_PER_FILE)
position ADR % CUBER_PER_FILE


Rebalancing DT tree:

Calculate height of each node in DT tree will be very costly since it requires reading/writing to file for all cubes.

If height is to high when you inseart a node then walk on step up and count all child nodes until you can decrese hight with x by perfectly balancing the tree bellow there.
Perfect balance in "Balance tree 1986.pdf", and this method might be used in "Balance tree uppsala.pdf" if I understood correct.


TODO:
* Write stats when starting new tests (testNodeId, nodeCount, moveCount, treeDepth)
* Fix start from file (only works if data file is removed now).
* Rebalance part of tree to height A if height is above B
* Unload part of tree
* Support multiple datafiles
* Sanity-check on files before starting (if program was aborten in the middle of a write).
